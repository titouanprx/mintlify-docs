# LinkUp API

The LinkUp API lets you automate your LinkedIn interactions programmatically. Our API provides comprehensive access to LinkedIn features including profile management, messaging, networking, and post interactions.

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key that must be included in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your_api_key" https://api.linkupapi.com/v1/...
```

### LinkedIn Authentication

**Important**: All endpoints except the authentication endpoints (`/v1/auth/login` and `/v1/auth/verify`) require a valid LinkedIn authentication cookie (`li_at`). This cookie is obtained after successfully logging in through our authentication endpoints.
Read the Getting LinkedIn Cookie channel for more information
## Common Parameters

Most endpoints require these parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| x-api-key | header | Yes | Your API authentication key |
| login_cookie | body | Yes* | LinkedIn authentication cookie (li_at) |
| country | body | No | Proxy country code (default: "FR"), Available: (US,UK,FR) |

*Not required for authentication endpoints

## Rate Limiting

- 300 requests per minute per API key



## Credits Usage Policy
Important: All API calls consume credits regardless of the status code returned (except for 500 server errors). This is because the resources are used to process your request even if it results in an error. Most errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 429) are due to user-side issues like:
* Invalid parameters
* Authentication problems
* Expired tokens
* Resource not found
* Rate limit exceeded

These errors consume credits as they result from client-side issues rather than server problems. Only 500 server errors, which indicate problems on our end, will not consume credits.


## Response Format

All responses for data scraping are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```
Other responses:
 
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Success description"
 }
```
## Error Handling

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always store and reuse the LinkedIn authentication cookie (li_at) until it expires
2. Implement proper error handling for rate limits and cookie expiration
3. Use appropriate country codes when needed for geolocation-specific requests
4. Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code
