## Company API
Search and retrieve company information from LinkedIn.

## Person API

## Authentication

All Data API endpoints require authentication using your LinkedIn token. Make sure you have obtained a valid token through our [Authentication process](/api-reference/linkedin-engagement-api/getting-linkedin-cookie).
