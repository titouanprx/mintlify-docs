# Getting LinkedIn Authentication Cookie

To use most endpoints of the LinkUp API, you need a valid LinkedIn authentication cookie (li_at). There are two methods to obtain this cookie, with our authentication API being the recommended approach.

## Method 1: Using LinkUp Authentication API (Recommended)

Our authentication API provides the most reliable and secure way to obtain the LinkedIn cookie. This method automatically handles IP matching and security challenges.

### Important Note ⚠️

The login endpoint should be used sparingly. Once you obtain a valid li_at cookie, it remains valid for 365 days. You should:
- Store the cookie securely after first authentication
- Reuse the same cookie for all subsequent requests
- Only re-authenticate if the cookie becomes invalid

### Advantages:


1. **Automatic IP Handling**
   - Cookie is automatically configured to work with our proxy network
   - No need to worry about IP matching
   - Works seamlessly with all API endpoints

2. **Security Management**
   - Handles LinkedIn security challenges automatically
   - Manages verification codes when required
   - Reduces risk of account restrictions

### How to Use:

Read the Authentication part.

### Response Example:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Login successful",
  "login_cookie": "XXXX..."  // Your LinkedIn cookie - valid for 365 days
}
```

## Method 2: Manual Extraction (Alternative Method)

If needed, you can manually extract the cookie from your browser. However, this method requires careful attention to IP addresses and is generally less reliable.

### Steps:

1. **Install Cookie Editor Extension**
   - For Chrome: Install [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg)
   - For Firefox: Install [Cookie Editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/edit-cookie/)

2. **Login to LinkedIn**
   - Go to [LinkedIn.com](https://www.linkedin.com)
   - Login with your account credentials
   - Complete any security verifications if prompted

3. **Extract the Cookie**
   - Click on the EditThisCookie extension icon
   - Look for the cookie named "li_at"
   - Copy its value - it should be a long string of characters

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

When using manual extraction, be aware of these critical points:

1. **IP Address Matching**
   - The IP address/location you use to log in MUST match the one you'll use with our API
   - Using different IPs can trigger LinkedIn's security measures
   - This can lead to cookie invalidation or account security checks

2. **Security Risks**
   - Never share your li_at cookie
   - It provides full access to your LinkedIn account
   - Store it securely like any other authentication token

## Best Practices

1. **Cookie Storage**
   - Store the cookie securely in your environment variables or secure storage
   - Never expose it in client-side code or version control
   - Implement proper access controls

2. **Usage Pattern**
   - Get the cookie once through our API
   - Store it securely
   - Reuse it for all requests until it expires (365 days)
   - Only re-authenticate if you get a 403 error

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Cookie Invalid**
   - Check if the cookie has expired (after 365 days)
   - Verify cookie format is correct
   - Use the authentication API to get a new cookie

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Avoid making login requests if you already have a valid cookie
   - Store and reuse the cookie instead of authenticating repeatedly
