title: 'Getting LinkedIn Authentication Token'
description: 'How to obtain the LinkedIn authentication token (li_at)'
---

To use most endpoints of the LinkUp API, you need a valid LinkedIn authentication token (li_at). Our authentication API provides the recommended approach to obtain this token.

## Using LinkUp Authentication API

Our authentication API provides the most reliable and secure way to obtain the LinkedIn token. This method automatically handles IP matching and security challenges.

### Important Note ⚠️

The login endpoint should be used sparingly. Once you obtain a valid li_at token, it remains valid for 365 days. You should:
- Store the token securely after first authentication
- Reuse the same token for all subsequent requests
- Only re-authenticate if the token becomes invalid

### Advantages:

1. **Automatic IP Handling**
   - Token is automatically configured to work with our proxy network
   - No need to worry about IP matching
   - Works seamlessly with all API endpoints

2. **Security Management**
   - Handles LinkedIn security challenges automatically
   - Manages verification codes when required
   - Reduces risk of account restrictions

### How to Use:

Read the Authentication part of our documentation for detailed instructions.

### Response Example:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Login successful",
  "login_token": "XXXX..."  // Your LinkedIn token - valid for 365 days
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Token Storage**
   - Store the token securely in your environment variables or secure storage
   - Never expose it in client-side code or version control
   - Implement proper access controls

2. **Usage Pattern**
   - Get the token once through our API
   - Store it securely
   - Reuse it for all requests until it expires (365 days)
   - Only re-authenticate if you get a 403 error

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Token Invalid**
   - Check if the token has expired (after 365 days)
   - Verify token format is correct
   - Use the authentication API to get a new token

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Avoid making login requests if you already have a valid token
   - Store and reuse the token instead of authenticating repeatedly
